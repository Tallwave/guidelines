# Team

If you're reading this page, you probably want to know more about the actual development team at Tallwave. Maybe you're considering joining us. Maybe you're just curious. Maybe you already work here and just want a refresher. Regardless, here are the nuts and bolts of what it is like to a developer.

## Your Career

Titles are a weird thing. Just the title alone can cause division. _“How come I’m not a Senior Architect III and *Billy* is?”_ kind of things. We want to be thoughtful about how we approach this, and foster growth and a desire to improve as a developer. Additionally, title can be a shorthand to convey to each other and clients what level of experience someone may have.

### What title is not
One title isn’t “higher” in the org chart than another. We’re a pretty flat organization and that benefits us. A Lead Developer is not anyone’s boss, though they should be demonstrating leadership. In fact, everyone can (and should) be demonstrating leadership, regardless of title.

There is no pressure to gain ‘rank’ just for the sake of doing so. If you’re happy at Software Developer, that’s great. Keep it up. However, it can be pretty fulfilling to add some more arrows to your quiver.

These are more what you call [guidelines, not actual rules](https://youtu.be/jl0hMfqNQ-g).

All developers, regardless of title need to carry themselves well, have empathy for others, and demonstrate our Core Values.

All developers will be able to perform code reviews and give constructive feedback.

### Software Developer

**Traits**

* Productive in at least one area such as Front-end, Back-end, Mobile, CMS, or other.
* Can work with minimal supervision. Nobody wants to be micromanaged or do the micromanaging.
* Communicate with clients effectively. Clients can be daunting, but we need to present ourselves in a way that carries crispness and excellence that people have come to expect from Tallwave.

It should be noted that this is explicitly not a “Junior” role. We don’t really do that kind of thing here. Even our interns are expected to be able to deliver some results and know a thing or two.

**Day to day examples**

A Software Developer will participate in Sprint planning and provide feedback about stories.

They’ll take on a task filed in an issue tracker, code it up and submit a PR, and write good documentation around it (if necessary).

They’ll file great bug reports when encountered.

### Senior Software Developer

**Traits**

* Productive in at least two areas, ideally in more.
* Deep understanding of one area.
* Doesn't require supervision.
* Mentors less experienced developers.
* Can serve as a Subject Matter Expert in sales calls.
* Can propose ideas, discuss, and disagree properly with clients, including stakeholders.
* Capable of public speaking and spreading the Good Word from time to time. This one especially is not a hard & fast rule because a lot of people fear this more than dying.

**Day to Day Examples**

A Senior Developer can run Sprint planning and grooming meetings.

They can also run a Storycarding or Feature Diagramming session, and write Technical Requirements Docs.

They’ll be coding a lot, and expected to have well factored results. This code should have intelligently written tests to go along with it.

### Lead Software Developer

**Traits**
* Can lead a team of developers. This is different from management.
* Can pick up a new technology and be productive fairly quickly
* Does a lot of non-coding stuff such as:
  * Requirements gathering
  * Customer management
  * Sales support
* Manages clients, coaches them, and get’s them on board with the Goal for the engagement.
* Makes their practice better.
* Demonstrates excellence in:
  * Team dynamics
  * Planning and estimating
  * Keeping projects on the rails

**Day to Day Examples**

A Lead Dev will have a high degree of ownership in their stack. They’ll be able to help write out plans for how work should be done and set goals for a group to work towards.

Leads mentor more inexperienced developers more often. This could be answering questions, pair programming, or running code reviews. Leads help Software Developers grow to Seniors and Seniors to Leads.

They have more conversations with clients. Per the description, Leads will be presenting project plans to clients, getting their buy-in, and working with the PM team to keep them apprised every step of the way.

## Beyond Lead
This hasn’t been figured out yet. One answer beyond “Lead” is “Management” however just because someone is a great developer doesn’t mean they’ll be a good manager (or even a mediocre one), so it is important to have some sort of advancement plan that does not involve transitioning to management.

We can say that whatever role this is will be much more highly consultative. The knowledge that this individual has is incredibly useful and will be of great importance to our clients. They'll be able to tackle problems like "design a resilient micro-service architecture on AWS that can handle a few million sessions per month and can scale way beyond that." without breaking a sweat.

## Advancement
You've heard it said that you should dress for the job you want, well similarly, if you want to be a Senior or a Lead developer, you should already be demonstrating those traits. In other words if you ask for a promotion, it shouldn't cause your manager to hesitate.

You should also have a plan and some goals to be working towards, even if you are not looking for a promotion. Goals are tricky. Like estimating software in general, it's quite easy to overestimate how much you can accomplish in a year's time. And in our business, client work has a tendency to take up as much free time as possible, so while special consideration will be given if it's been a particularly busy time, we need to strive to make forward progress.

## 1:1s
You will be having a [one-on-one](http://randsinrepose.com/archives/the-update-the-vent-and-the-disaster/) meeting regularly with your manager. This should be every week, barring illness or holiday. Half an hour is the norm, but these can definitely stretch out to longer should the need arise. 

In the one-on-one you'll discuss how you're feeling. This is not a status update, though it may relate to the status of a project. How are you feeling? Happy? Stressed?
Are you freaking out about something in particular?

We'll also have conversations about various topics and ask specific questions, like ["If you were CEO of this company, what would you change?"](https://jasonevanish.com/2014/05/29/101-questions-to-ask-in-1-on-1s/). This is so that you and your manager can get to get to know each other a little bit better and also to keep things fresh, you never know what might come out of that conversation.

From time to time you'll review those goals and how progress is going to hit those.

General business info may be distributed via one on ones too. Like when we have a new cover letter for the TPS reports.

## Diversity
[A diverse set of views makes a company better](https://www.mckinsey.com/business-functions/organization/our-insights/why-diversity-matters). When we hire we consider diversity. That doesn't mean we target a specifc skin tone or gender, but special care is taken to more sure that we are not a homogenous voice. This really isn't a complicated subject, and therefore it's a short paragraph.

## Internship
We love interns! We are actively working on an internship program that we will enact in Summer 2018. Stay tuned!
