# Management

## Manager

**Traits**

* Capable of managing a team of 4 or more developers.
* Map out career plans for each of your team members and help them achieve their goals.
* Understands the strengths and weaknesses of their team and can coax the most value of those.
* Can jump into sales calls and support the team on those.
* Views projects not just at a technical level, but also from a personnel point of view too.
* Still has a strong mind towards the tech side and can consult in key areas.

Managers will still have a fair degree of expected billable time on projects, which means coding chops. The percent of billable time vs management time will be dependent on a number of factors, like team size and the specific needs of a project.


**Day to Day Examples**

A Manager will be having 1:1s weekly with their direct reports.

They'll be removing impediments from their team.

Managers attend a lot of meetings. These will be a mix of management-type meetings, planning, strategy, and collaboration with other departments.

## I want to be a manager
Ok. Management is a career reset. You will need to exercise a lot of mental muscles you may not know about at the moment. You will be coding less and less on the job (and then not at all). The responsibilities and pressure increases significantly too. When things go south, guess who's neck looks the longest? If that sounds like a fun time to you, then here's how it'll work.

You should already have been at the Senior Developer level for a couple of years, probably even at Lead. If management is one of your career goals you should discuss it with your current manager. They can help you plan for that. When the time is right we will give you a supervisory role over several people and evaluate how that goes. This is a little different than the title of manager, in that you have direct reports, and will be expected to coach and grow them, but without the responsibility of recruiting and discipline.

If that supervisory period goes well, and the timing and budget permits, you will be made an official manager. If it turns out the supervisory period doesn't work, that's ok, as stated, management is definitely not for everybody. In that case, you'll go back to your regular non-supervisory duties.
